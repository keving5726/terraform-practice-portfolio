# Terraform Practice Portfolio

Welcome to my Terraform Practice Portfolio!

This repository contains a collection of hands-on Terraform practices designed to help you master Infrastructure as Code (IaC) by deploying various AWS resources and architectures.

## :file_folder: Practice Structure

Each folder represents an independent Terraform practice with its own focus and learning objectives:

- [basic-ec2](basic-ec2): Deploy a simple AWS EC2 instance. Perfect for beginners to get familiar with Terraform basics and AWS resource provisioning.
- [web-server-ec2](web-server-ec2): Deploy a web server on a single EC2 instance with custom configuration. Great for understanding server provisioning and configuration management.
- [web-server-cluster](web-server-cluster): Set up a scalable web server cluster. Learn about load balancing and managing multiple instances for high availability.
- [multi-tier-webapp](multi-tier-webapp): Build a multi-tier web application architecture. Demonstrates how to organize infrastructure with separate layers like presentation, application, and data.
- [s3backend_dynamodb](s3backend_dynamodb): Configure a Terraform backend using Amazon S3 with DynamoDB for state locking. This practice demonstrates how to manage remote state with locking to prevent conflicts in team environments and how to use workspaces. However, this setup is no longer recommended since Amazon S3 now provides a native state locking feature that simplifies and improves backend management.
- [s3backend](s3backend): Learn how to use Terraform’s remote backend with Amazon S3 to store infrastructure state. This practice also introduces the use of workspaces to manage multiple environments or configurations within the same project, helping organize and control state versions effectively.

## :rocket: Getting Started

**NOTE**: These practices will deploy real resources into your AWS account. Remember to delete created resources to avoid charges on your AWS account.

Follow these steps to run any practice:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/keving5726/terraform-practice-portfolio.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the practice folder you want to try, for example:
   ```bash
   cd terraform-practice-portfolio/basic-ec2
   ```

3. Initialize Terraform (downloads providers and configures backend):
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. Preview the changes Terraform will make:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. Apply the configuration to create resources:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

6. When done, clean up resources to avoid costs:
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

## :bulb: Tips & Best Practices

- Each practice is self-contained, feel free to experiment without affecting others.
- Always run `terraform plan` before `terraform apply` to review changes.
- Check for any **README.md** file inside each practice folder for specific instructions.
- Remember to run `terraform destroy` at the end of the practice to avoid charges.
